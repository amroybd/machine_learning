## Description of the folders and files
**- Decision_tree_HW_implementation:** Decision tree to if-else code and decision table. Then implement the decision table into FPGA ( Alveo )

**- Sklearn_Decision_Tree_Implemented_on_FPGA:** Decision tree to if-else code and then implement that if-else code into FPGA ( Alveo )

**- CNN_float32_to_int8_conversion.ipynb:** CNN model training and convert float32 model to int8 model

**- CNN_for_Human_activity.ipynb:** Implement non image data into CNN

**- image_classification.ipynb:** Train a CNN model and demonstrated the use of data pipelining and data augmentation. [Dataset used](https://www.kaggle.com/arjuntejaswi/plant-village) for the model training

**- large_tree_to_decision_table.ipynb:** The tree trained in this notebook has 128189 nodes. Which is a very large decision tree. Here, I have demonstrated how any tree can be converted into a decision table and use that table to make predictions.
